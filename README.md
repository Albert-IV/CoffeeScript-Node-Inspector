CoffeeScript Node Inspector
===========================

Handy little Bash script to auto-start [Node Inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) and launch your CoffeeScript application in one go.  Copy `c-inspect` into your /usr/bin/ directory, set your permissions, and you're set!

`$ c-inspect app-to-debug.coffee`

Then you'll be able to go to [node-inspector](http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug?port=5858) in your browser!
